# Frindr :coffee:
A Node/Express.js friend-matching app

## Images

### Home Page
![home page](app/public/images/frindr.png?raw=true "Home Page")

### Survey

Fill out a short survey.  Your scores are matched with other users to find your most compatible friend.  If friends are tied for compatibility, all matches are returned.

![survey](app/public/images/survey.png?raw=true "Survey Page") 


### Modal


Upon completion of the survey, you will be presented with your perfect match(es). Your profile will be added to the API (data is not persistent--see Next Steps).

![matches](app/public/images/matches.png?raw=true "Matches Example")


## Dependencies
* express.js
* body-parser
* express-favicon

## Next Steps
I plan to incorporate a database, user authentication, and a more-detailed survey in the future.
